"""Guards the macOS code-signing-identity contract across its three homes:
build_pyinstaller.py, the two macOS CI workflows, and the cert-generation
script.

These are source-text tests, not functional ones: the signing itself runs
`codesign`/`security` on a real Mac, which a Windows test host can't do.
What CAN be pinned down here is the contract that makes the fix work -- the
build reads MACOS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY and falls back to ad-hoc, the workflows
import the p12 and export the matching identity, and the script is
idempotent-safe. A regression in any one of those is silent until a real
macOS update re-prompts a user, so the cheap text assertion is worth it.

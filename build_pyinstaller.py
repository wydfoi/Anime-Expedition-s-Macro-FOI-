"""
Build the exe with PyInstaller -- bundles the interpreter + bytecode with no
compile step, so CI builds finish in well under a minute instead of
Nuitka's 10-20+ minute C compile. Trade-off: bundled Python bytecode is far
easier to decompile back to readable source than Nuitka's compiled machine
code -- an acceptable trade here since this whole repo is public source
anyway (nothing proprietary to protect by making it hard to reverse).

The very first packaged build of this app used PyInstaller and crashed on
launch ("Failed to resolve Python.Runtime.Loader") because PyInstaller's
own pywebview hook doesn't collect webview.platforms.win32, which
winforms.py imports unconditionally -- the exact same root cause Nuitka's
bundled plugin had (see the git history for build_nuitka.py, since
replaced by this file). Fixed here with explicit --hidden-import flags
instead of switching build tools blind a second time.

Requires:
    py -3.12 -m pip install pyinstaller
    py -3.12 build_pyinstaller.py

Output: dist/Anime Expeditions.exe

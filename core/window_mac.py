"""macOS implementation of core.window's API (see core/window.py for how
the dispatch works, core/window_win.py for the Win32 original each
function mirrors).

A "window handle" here is a CGWindowID (the integer the window server
uses) so the int-shaped hwnd plumbing through main/runner/dock keeps
working unchanged. Two macOS realities shape everything below:

1. READING window state (enumerate, rects, z-order, capture) is easy and
   permissionless-ish via Quartz's CGWindowList APIs (capture needs the
   Screen Recording permission).

2. CHANGING another app's windows (move/resize/raise) is only possible
   through the Accessibility API (AXUIElement), which requires the user
   to grant this app Accessibility permission in System Settings >
   Privacy & Security. Every AX call here is best-effort: without the
   permission it fails quietly and the macro logs/limps rather than
   crashing -- ax_trusted() is surfaced at startup so the user gets told
   exactly what to enable.

There is deliberately NO SetParent equivalent: macOS cannot reparent
another process's window, period. set_parent/get_parent/remove_borders/
restore_borders exist as no-op stubs purely so core.dock's shared call
sites don't need per-platform guards -- the darwin GameDocker (see
core/dock.py) arranges windows side by side instead of embedding.

UNTESTED-ON-REAL-MAC NOTE for testers: pyobjc attribute names and the
title-bar height estimate (_TITLEBAR_PT) are the two most likely things
to need a first-run fix. debug.log will show any AX/Quartz exception
with a [window_mac] prefix.

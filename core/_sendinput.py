"""Low-level Win32 SendInput plumbing shared by Mouse and Keyboard.

SendInput is used instead of SetCursorPos/mouse_event/pyautogui's default
backend because it pushes events through the real input stack, which is
what most games (and DirectInput titles) actually listen to. Cursor-only
writes are ignored by a lot of games.

    # of that band, which is the furthest possible from either edge.

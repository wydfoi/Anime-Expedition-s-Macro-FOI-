"""Finds a known UI element on screen by matching a reference image against a
live screenshot of the docked Roblox window -- what the macro runner (see
core.runner) uses to click things whose position isn't fixed/known in advance
(a menu that slides in, a button that only exists on certain screens) instead
of a hardcoded coordinate.

Reference images live in Assets/ui/<name>/ -- one FOLDER per searched name,
holding one or more .png crops that are all tried as interchangeable variants
of the same button/text (see template_variant_paths). Matching is done in grayscale,
not color: this game's UI text sits on a gradient fill (its color shifts
across the glyph) and buttons vary in on-screen brightness with the moment's
lighting/animation, so a 3-channel color match would be comparing exact pixel
color where none is reliably constant. Grayscale keeps the shape/edge
information that *is* consistent, ignores color variation that isn't, and
runs faster (1 channel vs 3) -- OpenCV's matchTemplate normalizes brightness
and contrast per-window anyway (TM_CCOEFF_NORMED), so grayscale doesn't lose
matching power here, it just drops the noisy channel.

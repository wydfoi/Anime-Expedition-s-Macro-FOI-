"""
Build the tiny bootstrapper exe with PyInstaller. It only imports
`requests` + stdlib (no OpenCV/numpy/pywebview/mss/keyboard), so it comes
out much smaller than the full app -- small enough to share as a single
file (e.g. on Discord). On first run it downloads the release zip (the
real exe + the user-editable Assets/ folder) from GitHub Releases,
extracts it beside itself, and launches the app; see bootstrap.py.

Requires:
    py -3.12 -m pip install pyinstaller
    py -3.12 build_bootstrap.py

Output: dist/Anime Expeditions Bootstrapper.exe

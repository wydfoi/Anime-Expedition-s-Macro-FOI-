Reference images the macro's image search (core/vision.py, core/runner.py)
looks for by name. Each is a small, tightly cropped screenshot of just the
button/text being searched for -- not a full screen capture. See
Assets/README.txt for how this folder relates to the others (item_icons,
maps, stage_data.json).

Folder names must match the `name` string a runner call passes to
core.vision.find_image(hwnd, "<name>", ...) EXACTLY -- no normalizing of
spaces/case. Windows' filesystem is case-insensitive, so a casing mismatch
still resolves fine, but a SPACE where the code has an underscore does
not. Every name in this folder is lowercase snake_case with no spaces for
exactly that reason -- keep any new one the same way.

FOLDER LAYOUT (one folder per searched name)
--------------------------------------------
Every searched name has its OWN subfolder here, named exactly after it:

  Assets/ui/nav_play/nav_play.png
  Assets/ui/victory/victory.png
  ...

and every .png inside a name's folder is tried as an interchangeable
variant of that one name when the macro searches for it (see core.vision.
template_variant_paths -- <name>.png is tried first, extras after it, and
the scale sweep only starts once every variant missed at its true size).
That's the whole point of the layout: if a button renders differently on
your setup, ADD another crop of it to that folder instead of overwriting
the shipped one, and the search tries both.

Names that LOOK related are still separate names on purpose:
exp_extract_continue/ and continue_2/ are different folders because the
runner means different things by them (the extract checkpoint's decline
choice vs a follow-up screen's button), same for nav_start_game/ vs
nav_start_game_confirm/ (ready-up vs a "Start Anyway"-style second
confirm). An image only ever counts as a variant of the folder it sits in.

A loose Assets/ui/<name>.png (no folder) still resolves too -- handy for a
quick hand-dropped file -- but new images should go in folders; that's
where the Image Manager saves them.

ADDING / REPLACING AN IMAGE YOURSELF
-------------------------------------
If a button isn't being found/clicked reliably on your setup (a common
cause: Roblox rendering its UI at a slightly different size -- see
core.vision.SCALE_FACTORS, which already tries a few scales automatically
before giving up), add YOUR screen's crop of it as an extra variant:

Easiest way -- entirely in-app, no image editor:
1. In the macro, open Settings > General > Image Manager.
2. Get Roblox showing the button, press "Capture Roblox", drag a box
   tightly around just the button/text (scroll to zoom in first -- crops
   are small), pick the name from the save box (see the catalog below for
   which name goes with which button), Save Crop.
3. Done -- the very next search already tries it, no restart needed.

By hand, if you prefer:
1. Settings > General > "Open Assets Folder" opens this exact folder next
   to the exe (it is NOT baked into the app -- releases ship it loose,
   precisely so you can edit it).
2. Crop a tight screenshot of just the button/text, background included,
   and save it as another .png inside that name's folder (any filename).
3. Settings > General > "Reload Vision Images" (or restart) so the
   running app picks it up.

Deleting a shipped image you've decided is wrong for your setup is fine
too -- updates only ever ADD missing files here, they never overwrite or
resurrect ones you've changed or removed... except a fully deleted
file/folder, which the next update's add-only merge will restore from the
release. To permanently replace a shipped crop, overwrite the file's
contents rather than deleting it.

CATALOG
-------

nav_play.png
  The Play button on the Nav bar (bottom-left menu: Store/Units/Items/
  Quests/Summon/Areas/Play/Events). Searched for inside a fixed region
  (core.runner.NAV_PLAY_REGION) in the docked game window's own
  coordinates, both to confirm you're on the lobby (it only renders there)
  and to click it. The region is padded well past the button's own size on
  purpose -- gives template matching room to find it even if it's drifted
  a bit, see the region's own comment in core/runner.py.

nav_back.png
  The "Back" button shown on the gamemode-select screen (Story/Raid/
  Expedition/...) after Play is clicked. Used only to CONFIRM that menu
  has actually finished opening -- once it's found, Story is clicked at
  the fixed coordinate (666, 147) rather than via image search (see
  core.runner.STORY_CLICK).

nav_disband.png
  Optional. Checked right before clicking the gamemode card (Story/Raid/
  Challenge/Expedition) for a party prompt that can block the click.
  Folder variants cover both "Disband Party" and incoming-invite
  "Decline" buttons. The prompt is dismissed and verified before the
  gamemode click; a missing template just skips the optional check.

invite_players_open.png / invite_players_close.png
  Optional. The outgoing "Invite Players" browser can also block a
  gamemode click after an accidental click on a player portrait or invite
  control. Its unique title must be detected before the generic-looking
  Close button is accepted; the same zero-hold, park, and verify recovery
  used for Disband/Decline then clears it. If the intended gamemode click
  itself opened this browser, that exact gamemode is retried once.

story/
  The Story gamemode card. Searched first (its folder holds two crops of
  the same card -- one alone wasn't distinct enough to match reliably,
  see core.runner._click_gamemode), falling back to the fixed coordinate
  STORY_CLICK if neither image matches.

raid.png
  Used to find and click Raid on the gamemode menu (Story's neighboring
  card) -- unlike Story, Raid has no hardcoded click point, so this is
  searched for instead. Tight crop of just the word (see
  core.runner._click_gamemode).

expedition.png
  Same idea as raid.png, for the Expedition gamemode card.

nav_tower.png
  The Tower gamemode card on the Play menu, same idea as raid.png /
  expedition.png and nav_tournament. Crop tightly around the Tower card;
  add variants in nav_tower/ if Image Manager crops differ on your setup.

dialogue_engage.png / dialogue_yes.png
  The Expedition encounter NPC's dialogue buttons (see
  core.runner_expedition._run_encounter_dialogue). Crop tightly around the
  WORD, not the whole pill: the pill recolours between encounters -- green
  one time, red or pink the next -- while the label does not. The menu is
  four options wide (Discuss / Barter / Engage / Leave), which is why these
  are searched for rather than clicked at a fixed spot.
  Optional: with neither installed the exchange falls back to the older
  fixed click sequence (ENCOUNTER_DIALOGUE_CLICKS), which only fits the
  layout it was measured on. Adding your own crop is the fix if the
  dialogue never advances on your setup.

expedition_flower_forest.png / expedition_rose_kingdom.png
  Expedition's own map cards (core.runner._select_expedition_map,
  EXPEDITION_MAP_IMAGES) -- clicked to pick that map on the Expedition
  screen. School Grounds has NO image here: it's whatever's selected by
  default when the screen opens, so no search/click happens for it at all.

Traitless_Tower.png
  Tower's Traitless option on the Tower screen. Normal needs no image; it is
  clicked only when Traitless is selected for the task. Crop tightly around
  the Traitless option and add variants if needed.

nav_select_stage.png
  The confirm button that finalizes a Story/Raid map+stage+difficulty
  pick. Waited on to confirm the stage-select screen has opened (Raid
  reuses the same screen as Story, just a different row layout), then
  clicked (verified/retried) to move on to Start/Enter Matchmaking.

stage_infinite/
  The infinity glyph in Story's Infinite row. Searched only inside the
  left stage-list column, with variants from both observed 1152x756 UI
  layouts. The row is clicked at the match center and its blue selected
  state is verified before Select Stage is allowed to run.

exp_select_stage.png
  Expedition's equivalent of nav_select_stage.png -- its own confirm
  button after picking a map and difficulty, Solo mode only (matchmaking
  skips straight to exp_enter_matchmaking.png below).

enter_matchmaking.png / exp_enter_matchmaking.png
  "Enter Matchmaking", matchmaking play mode only, searched for after the
  stage/difficulty confirm click. enter_matchmaking.png is restricted to a
  calibrated region (coords.matchmaking_region_*) for Story/Raid;
  exp_enter_matchmaking.png is searched full-window instead since
  Expedition has no calibrated region for it.

nav_start.png
  Solo mode's "Start" button, clicked once the stage/difficulty confirm
  screen closes (core.runner._click_start_and_wait_teleport). Re-clicked
  only while still visible (a dropped click); once it's gone, that's
  success and the runner waits on nav_unitmanager.png instead of
  continuing to click a button that already worked.

nav_unitmanager.png
  Only renders once you're actually inside a match -- polled continuously
  as the actual confirmation a teleport-in finished (used by both the
  initial entry and every repeat's re-teleport).

warning.png
  Optional. If a warning popup is blocking Start Game right after Pre
  Start finishes, the runner waits up to 10s for it to clear before
  searching for Start Game at all.

nav_start_game/
  The in-match "Start Game" (ready-up) button -- its folder holds every
  visual variant seen in practice (the crops once named _3/_4 live here
  now), all tried per search (core.runner._find_start_game_button), so the
  actual click isn't dependent on just one of them matching.
  nav_start_game alone is also used earlier to check party leadership
  (only the leader sees it) before Pre Start runs.

nav_start_game_confirm/
  NOT a variant of the above (it was misleadingly named nav_start_game_2
  once): a second Start Game/confirm button (e.g. a "Start Anyway" prompt)
  that can appear alongside a warning -- searched on its own by
  core.runner._click_start_game_2_if_found to skip the warning wait, and
  also tried as a start click by _find_start_game_button.

victory.png / defeat.png
  Story/Raid's match-result screen, polled throughout battle
  (core.runner._wait_for_match_result). Expedition wins differently (see
  exp_continue.png/exp_extract.png below) but a FAILED expedition run ends
  on the same Defeat screen -- defeat.png is checked there too, and a hit
  makes the task repeat the expedition via Repeat Stage like any other
  loss (core.runner._check_expedition_wave_result). If Expedition's defeat
  art ever renders differently on your setup, add a crop of it to the
  defeat/ folder as another variant. Victory's current-layout variants
  also cover internal UI rendering from 85-115%.

next_floor.png / repeat_floor.png
  Tower's result-screen floor buttons. Next Floor advances to the next floor;
  Repeat Floor retries the current floor. Crop tightly around each button and
  add variants if the result screen renders differently on your setup.

School Grounds.png / Rose Kingdom.png / Fairy King Forest.png /
King's Tomb.png / Flower Forest.png
  Regular Challenge map detection (core.runner._detect_current_challenge_
  map) -- Challenge is Story's own flow, just with the game picking a
  random one of these 5 maps for you instead of you picking it, so this
  is a "which one did it land on" check, NOT the map-card search
  Assets/maps/<map>.png does (different folder, different purpose --
  that one's for scrolling/clicking a map by NAME in Story's own map
  carousel, this is for recognizing a map that's already showing).

challenge.png
  Regular Challenge's gamemode card, same idea as raid.png/expedition.png
  (core.runner._click_gamemode) -- found by image search on the Play
  menu, no fixed coordinate like Story's. Folder variants cover both
  observed card/text scales.

challenge_loaded.png
  Confirms the Challenge screen has actually finished opening
  (core.runner._open_challenge_screen) before selecting Daily Challenge
  or clicking a Regular stage slot -- a load-
  confirmation banner, not a button, so it's only waited on, never
  clicked itself. Folder variants cover older and current layouts.

daily_challenge_available.png / daily_challenge_unavailable.png
  The green/gray Daily Challenge tab states. Available is clicked to open
  the once-per-game-day challenge; Unavailable is the game's source of
  truth that it should be skipped until the next 00:00 UTC reset. Folder
  variants cover 85-115% internal UI rendering.

daily_challenge_stage.png
  The common "Daily Challenge #1" heading on the current daily map card.
  Clicking it opens the details with Select Stage / Enter Matchmaking;
  the map art and name change daily, so they are deliberately excluded.
  Folder variants cover 85-115% internal UI rendering.

daily_challenge_hud.png
  The shared green Daily Challenge label shown after teleport. It anchors
  a tight OCR crop over the tiny map name to its right, allowing the same
  post-teleport map-detection loop to recognize any of the Story maps
  without a per-map Daily screenshot. Small/large variants cover 85-115%
  internal UI rendering.

chal_enter.png
  Challenge's own "Enter Matchmaking" button, Matchmaking play mode only
  -- searched full-window (no calibrated region exists for it, same
  reasoning as exp_enter_matchmaking.png).

chal_select.png
  Challenge's own Select Stage button, Solo play mode only, clicked
  (verified/retried) right before the actual "Start" click
  (core.runner._enter_selected_challenge) -- Challenge's equivalent of
  nav_select_stage.png/exp_select_stage.png.

exp_continue.png / continue_2.png
  Expedition's wave-continue flow. exp_continue.png shows up once per
  wave clear -- clicking it, then waiting for continue_2 (or
  exp_extract_continue, whichever the game shows) and clicking that,
  moves on to the next wave.

exp_extract.png / exp_extract_continue.png / continue_2.png / extract.png /
extract_confirm.png
  Expedition's recurring checkpoint choice -- exp_extract.png shows up
  once per checkpoint, offering Extract or Continue side by side. Every
  sighting up to the task's configured "Extract After" count is declined
  (click exp_extract_continue -- the checkmarked "Continue" CHOICE that
  screen offers; it was named just "continue" once, renamed because a name
  that generic invited conflicts -- then wait for continue_2/
  exp_extract_continue and click that too, same two-step exp_continue's
  own flow uses, with a cooldown after so a laggy still-visible banner
  isn't miscounted as the next sighting); the sighting right after that is
  accepted (click exp_extract.png itself, wait for extract.png and click
  that). That opens a SECOND confirmation ("Extraction -- Are you sure
  you'd like to end this run?", its own separate red Extract/Cancel
  buttons, a rewards preview) -- extract_confirm.png is that dialog's own
  Extract button, optional/best-effort like nav_disband.png (missing just
  skips this step rather than failing). Clicking through both lands on the
  reward screen -- Expedition's equivalent of victory.png. A "Select an
  upgrade!" level-up reward-card modal (select upgrade card.png) can land
  on top of any of this, or right after Victory before Repeat/Leave Stage
  even renders -- dismissed with a middle-screen click wherever it might
  show up.

click_anywhere_to_close/
  Optional, checked every poll tick during battle ONLY on Spirit City Act
  3 (Raid) -- a boss/cutscene intro popup, clicked if found. Its folder
  holds every visual variant seen in practice, all tried per search. Besides
  the click-text crops, the folder includes fallback crops of the cutscene's
  sword, Lvl 1 strip, and 8th Sword title; any of those signals dismisses
  the same popup. Every file in this folder appears as a manager variant.

upgradeable.png / not_upgradeable.png
  Used by Battle-phase Upgrade Unit blocks (core.runner._run_upgrade_unit_tick).
  After clicking a placed unit, the runner searches for whichever of these
  actually renders on its info panel: upgradeable.png means click it now;
  not_upgradeable.png (greyed out / insufficient gold / on cooldown,
  whatever this game shows) means wait and retry later instead of clicking.

priority_upgrade/
  The Priority / Auto-Upgrade control on a unit's info panel -- labelled
  "Quote" in-game. Searched by Auto Upgrade Unit blocks whose Input is set
  to Click (core.runner_blocks._run_auto_upgrade_unit_tick): the runner
  selects the unit, finds this control, and CLICKS it once per priority
  step. It is a cycling button, not a menu -- priority N is N clicks, and
  one click past the last priority wraps back to off. Hotkey input never
  searches for it at all, which is also why Hotkey input cannot report
  whether it worked.

  This name's job is LOCATING the control, so its folder deliberately
  holds crops of it in EVERY state: the control is unset at the moment a
  priority is first applied, so an off-state crop has to match then. What
  each shipped file shows:

    off (cycle-arrow glyph) ..... priority_upgrade.png, _2, _9
    enabled, priority 1 ......... _1, _3
    enabled, priority 2 ......... _4
    enabled, priority 3 ......... _5
    enabled, priority 4 ......... _6
    enabled, priority 5 ......... _7
    enabled, priority 6 ......... _8

  Because it matches every state, this name cannot tell you WHICH state
  the control is in. Use quote_off/quote_on below for that.

quote_off/ and quote_on/
  The same control split by state, for Detect blocks that need to read
  whether auto-upgrade actually took: quote_off matches the unset (grey,
  cycle-arrow) button, quote_on the enabled (blue, numbered) one. No
  runner code searches for either -- they exist for user-built Detect
  conditions, e.g.

    find('quote_off') and not find('quote_on')

  meaning "this control is on screen and still unset". quote_on's files
  are named for the priority they show (quote_on_1.png, quote_on_2.png,
  ...), so quote_on_1 and quote_on_2 also resolve as search names of
  their own through the shallow-subfolder fallback described above, if
  you need to check for one specific priority.

  Setting a priority is NOT idempotent -- the control cycles, so applying
  "priority 2" a second time leaves it on 4. Gate any retry on a POSITIVE
  match of the unset state rather than on failing to match the set state:
  a missing image and an unopened panel both read as "not found", and a
  gate built the other way round turns every such unknown into a retry.

cannot_place.png / max_placement_reached.png
  Place Unit block, checked right after each placement click. Both
  optional -- missing template just skips the check. max_placement_reached
  means the unit cap is hit, abandoning the whole block; cannot_place
  (matched against the LOWEST/bottommost hit on screen, since rejection
  banners can stack) means the spot itself was blocked, triggering a
  nudge-and-retry loop instead.

unit_exist.png
  Same Place Unit block, post-placement verification -- checked first, one
  retry click if it's not there yet, re-checked. Missing template just
  disables the verification step entirely.

leave_stage.png
  Used in three places: quitting to menu on Stop/F2, the first step of
  mid-task recovery, and the normal end-of-run flow when no repeats are
  left (verified/retried click that backs out to the lobby). The live
  variant is the top-left door icon beside the cogwheel, which is present
  during an active stage and opens Exit Confirmation. Small/large variants
  cover internal UI rendering from 85-115%.

repeat_stage.png
  End-of-match flow when the task has repeats left (and isn't
  matchmaking) -- verified/retried click that re-queues the same stage,
  skipping the lobby/map/stage picks entirely.

return.png
  Optional. Leave Stage can bring up its own "Return to Lobby"
  confirmation instead of backing out on its own; polled briefly (not a
  one-shot check -- the popup can take a moment to animate in) right after
  every Leave Stage click and clicked if found. The live variant covers
  the larger red button shown by the active-stage Exit Confirmation, with
  small/large variants for 85-115% rendering.

result_modal_close.png
  Victory-only recovery. A stray click on a character/reward portrait can
  open its centered Obtainments modal over Repeat/Leave Stage. The macro
  finds this large Close button only in its middle-bottom band, clicks it
  without a hold to prevent click-through, parks the cursor, and verifies
  the modal closed. Folder variants cover 85-115% rendering.

team.png
  Used by Team Loadout application (core.runner._apply_team_loadout).
  After pressing H, the runner waits for this to confirm the team-select
  panel actually opened, then clicks it before picking a Loadout row.

team_loadout_open.png
  The "Unit Teams" title shown only after the Teams button successfully
  opens the Load Team list. The runner waits for this and retries Teams
  before it is allowed to scroll or click a loadout row.

confirm.png
  Used by Team Loadout application, right after clicking a Loadout row --
  confirms the choice before moving on to the equipment pick. Variants in
  this folder cover both the older and current Confirm button rendering.

include.png / exclude.png
  Used by Team Loadout application to pick Include or Exclude for
  equipment (whichever the task's template has set) after Confirm. Variants
  cover both the older buttons and the current Include Equipment dialog.

reconnect/
  Optional. Roblox's own "Reconnect"/"Retry" prompt, shown when it actually
  disconnects -- the folder holds every wording/art variant seen in
  practice (including the old separately-named retry.png), all tried per
  search. Checked every poll during a teleport-in wait, but unlike
  nav_unitmanager, finding it is treated as an immediate, definite
  disconnect (no continuous-visibility wait needed). Triggers a deep-link
  rejoin (core.runner._attempt_rejoin) -- skipped if any OTHER standalone
  Roblox window is currently open, since the deep link's own
  single-instance handling would force-close it.

teleportstuck/
  LEGACY -- this crop is Roblox's normal black loading screen, not a
  distinct error state, so it is deliberately not used as a disconnect
  signal. Slow legitimate teleports use the normal mode-specific timeout.

nav_settings.png / nav_search.png / toggle_true.png / toggle_false.png /
nav_settings_on.png
  Used by core.runner._open_settings_search/_search_and_set_toggle to
  open Settings, search a setting by name, and read/click its on/off
  toggle. Used by any Setting block of "toggle" kind (_run_setting_block).

restart_btn/
  UNUSED -- leftovers from an earlier "disable Auto Vote Start + restart
  the game via Settings" flow that's since been removed (most people run
  with Auto Vote Start on deliberately, so the macro no longer fights it;
  see core.runner's party-leadership check). Kept here rather than
  deleted in case that flow ever comes back, but nothing currently
  searches for either of these.

Add more <name>.png files here as new macro steps need to recognize other
buttons/screens -- core.vision.find_image(hwnd, "<name>", ...) will pick
up any file added under this folder automatically, no code change needed
beyond the step that calls it.

## Features

- **Docked automation** — Roblox is embedded as a native child window inside the macro's own UI, not remote-controlled from outside, so clicks and key presses land exactly where they should.
- **Task queue** — build a queue of Story, Raid, or Expedition tasks (map, stage/act/difficulty, Solo or Matchmaking, repeat count) and let the macro work through all of them in order.
- **Repeat farming with automatic recovery** — farm the same stage N times via Repeat Stage without re-doing the lobby/map/stage picks each run. A stuck battle or a missed click backs out to the lobby and retries automatically instead of derailing an unattended session.
- **Pre Start block builder (Macro Manager)** — a drag-and-drop editor for what happens before a match starts: place starter units (with click-verify and auto-nudge if a spot is rejected), flip in-game settings via hotkey, and mark any block "Once" so it only fires on a task's first entry into a stage, not every repeat.
- **Walk path recorder** — record a WASD(+ability-key) movement path once per map and replay it automatically as part of Pre Start.
- **Record block (TinyTask-style)** — a Pre Start/Battle block that records your full mouse + keyboard input (movement, clicks, scroll, any key) once and replays it with the original timing, for multi-step sequences the Click/Send Key/Walk blocks don't cover. Recordings are stored compactly and bundle into template/task exports and share codes.
- **Victory/Defeat detection + Discord match reports** — the result screen is detected automatically, recorded to your win/loss counts and run history, and (with a webhook configured) posted to Discord as a screenshot of the result screen plus a rendered win/loss card. Reading the match stats (clear time, Yen, kills, damage) and reward items off the screen is available on demand under Settings > Debug.
- **Discord webhook reporting** — optional win/loss embeds posted to a Discord channel as the macro runs.
- **Win/loss history & stats** — session and all-time win/loss counts, win rate, and a recent-run history, all in the Dashboard.
- **Global hotkeys** — start/stop/pause without touching the mouse, with the bound key shown right on the Dashboard's controls.
- **Daily + Regular Challenge automation** — configure both from Resource: Daily runs once per shared 00:00 UTC game day, while Regular can enable/disable each of its 3 rotating stage slots independently. Both reuse the same per-Story-map Macro Operations and support Solo or Matchmaking.
- **Multi-scale image matching** — automatically tries a template at a few scale factors when the exact size misses, absorbing UI that renders slightly bigger/smaller on someone else's setup instead of failing outright.
- **Replaceable reference images** — if a button still isn't matching reliably on your setup, drop a same-named screenshot into Settings > General > "Open Assets Folder" to override it — no rebuild or reinstall needed (see [`Assets/ui/README.txt`](Assets/ui/README.txt) for the full catalog of what each image is for).
- **Themes** — an independent Background (Dark, true Black, Slate, or Light) and Accent color pick, mix and match freely, under Settings > General.
- **Self-updating** — checks GitHub for new releases and offers a one-click update from inside the app (see [Auto-Updater](#auto-updater)).

## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** (primary platform) — or **macOS** via the experimental testing build, see [macOS](#macos-experimental--testers-wanted)
- **[Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/)** with Anime Expeditions
- **Python 3.10+**
- **[Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/)** (preinstalled on most Win10/11 systems)
- **[Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)** — required for reading match stats/rewards; pip cannot install this, grab the Windows installer from the link above

## Download & Install

### Option A: Download (recommended)

No `git clone`, no Python needed.

1. Open the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/Cweamy/Anime-Expeditions-Creams-Macro/releases/latest)
2. The newest release is shown at the top
3. Under **Assets**, download **`Creams-Macro-Anime-Expeditions-Windows.zip`** (or the `-macOS` zip on a Mac)
4. Extract it anywhere — you get the app `.exe` with an `Assets/` folder next to it — and run the exe

The `Assets/` folder is every image the macro searches for on screen, kept **outside** the exe on purpose: one folder per button/text, and you can open, replace, or add extra crops freely (Settings > General > **Image Manager** captures and crops them for you, straight from your Roblox screen). Updates never overwrite images you've changed or added.

(The old bootstrapper exe is no longer uploaded to releases — the zip is the one download. If you already have a bootstrapper from before, it keeps working: it fetches this same zip. Need a fresh one to share around? Build it locally with `build_bootstrap.py`.)

> Windows SmartScreen may warn about an unrecognized app the first time (normal for small open-source tools) — click **More info → Run anyway**, or build it yourself from source below.

The only other thing you need is [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) (pip can't install this one — grab the Windows installer from the link) for reading match stats/rewards; everything else works without it.

### Option B: Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cweamy/Anime-Expeditions-Creams-Macro.git
cd Anime-Expeditions-Creams-Macro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### macOS (experimental — testers wanted)

Releases also publish **`Creams-Macro-Anime-Expeditions-macOS.zip`** (an Intel/x86_64 `.app` + the same editable `Assets/` folder), and source runs work via `./run.sh`. Key differences and setup:

1. **Permissions (required):** System Settings > Privacy & Security — grant the app (or your terminal, for source runs) **Accessibility**, **Input Monitoring**, and **Screen Recording**. Without them, clicks silently do nothing and captures come back black. The app logs a warning at startup if Accessibility is missing.
2. **Side-by-side, not docked:** macOS can't embed another app's window, so Roblox is auto-arranged *next to* the control panel at the exact reference size instead of inside it. The panel sizes itself to whatever width the game doesn't need and to the full height of the screen's *visible* area (menu bar and Dock excluded), so nothing ends up under either.
3. **Screen space:** side-by-side needs about **1564 logical points of width** (400 panel + 1152 game). If your display is set to fewer — a 13" MacBook left at its default scaled resolution is 1440 or even 1280 wide — Roblox lands partly off-screen; the app logs exactly this at startup. Fix it in System Settings > Displays by picking a resolution toward **"More Space"** (this is about *logical* points, not the physical panel, so a Retina display stays sharp).
4. **The Dashboard drops the game slot.** On Windows the Dashboard reserves a 1152×756 hole for the embedded game; on mac there is nothing to put in it, so the Dashboard reflows to a single column — status, scoreboard, controls, run history, then the log — and the window widens to the full screen on the Task / Macro Manager / Challenge / Settings screens, which are multi-column and need the room. It stays narrow on the Dashboard so Roblox is visible beside it, and widens freely on the other screens even **mid-run** — reward/stats OCR reads Roblox's own window contents (window-content capture, see core/vision.py) rather than the screen, so covering the game doesn't break detection. (One deliberate exception: the placement-highlight scan is a small screen grab on mac because the highlight can be missing from window-content capture — see core/runner_blocks.py. Like all mac input it needs Roblox frontmost, which the runner re-establishes whenever it interacts.)
5. **Scaling:** all captures are normalized and clicks scaled automatically (Retina 2x included), so the same Assets images work — but expect to add your own crops via the Image Manager where Roblox's mac rendering differs. Image matching reads Roblox's own window contents rather than the screen, so another window sitting over the game doesn't break detection.
6. **Self-update** swaps the whole `.app` bundle in place (like the Windows exe swap), and the signed bundle is preserved as-is — so your permissions carry over (see below).
7. Global hotkeys need elevated permissions on macOS; without them, use the on-screen buttons.

### macOS permission persistence across updates

macOS remembers the Accessibility, Input Monitoring, and Screen Recording grants you approve by the app's **code identity**, not its name or location. An *ad-hoc* signature has no certificate, so that identity is the build's `cdhash` — which changes every build, making each update look like a brand-new app and re-prompting you for every permission. That is the "stuck in a permission loop" behavior.

Release builds are now signed with a **stable, self-signed code-signing certificate** created once and reused for every build, so every update is "the same app" to macOS and the grants you approved once keep working.

- **Testers:** nothing to do beyond the normal one-time grants in step 1.
- **Owner / release builds:** the stable identity lives in a certificate stored as two GitHub Actions repo secrets. Generate it once with `tools/make_macos_codesign_cert.sh` (any machine with OpenSSL), then add the two secrets it prints:
  - `MACOS_CODESIGN_P12` — the single-line base64 of the `.p12`
  - `MACOS_CODESIGN_PASSWORD` — the `.p12` password

  With those secrets set, the macOS CI jobs import the cert into a throwaway keychain and sign with it automatically. Without them, CI still builds — it just falls back to ad-hoc signing, so a one-off test build re-prompts after each update.

Either way, install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) if you haven't already (needed for stats/reward reading only — everything else works without it).

## Usage

If you're running from source, launch it with:

```bash
python main.py
```

...or just double-click `run.bat`. (If you used the bootstrapper, just run it — it launches the app for you.) Start Roblox and join Anime Expeditions — the macro finds and docks the window automatically. From there:

1. **Task** — queue up what to farm (map, stage, difficulty, repeat count).
2. **Macro Manager** — build a Pre Start routine (unit placement, settings, walk path, clicks) and save it as a template.
3. **Challenge** — optionally enable Regular Challenge automation and assign a Macro Operation per map (runs before the Task Queue on Start).
4. **Dashboard** — assign a template to a task, hit Start, and monitor progress/stats live.
5. **Settings** — hotkeys, Discord webhook, default walk paths, themes, and calibration/debug tools.

CLI diagnostics (no GUI) are available via:

```bash
python main.py --test
```

## Auto-Updater

On launch, the macro checks GitHub for a newer tagged release than the one you're running. If one exists, a popup shows the version and release notes with an **Update & Restart** button. What "Update" downloads depends on how you're running it — the packaged exe swaps itself for the new exe; running from source instead swaps in the new source over your local copy. Either way your `settings.json`, saved templates, walk paths, **and anything you've changed or added in the `Assets/` folder** are never touched — updates only ever *add* Assets images that are new in a release, and it relaunches automatically. You can also trigger a manual check any time by clicking the version badge in the titlebar. (If you're using the bootstrapper, it also checks for a newer app exe on every launch on its own, independently of this.)

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. Every push/PR runs CI on Windows: the `tests/` unit suite under pytest, a compile check over every Python file, and a syntax check of `ui/app.js`. Run the suite locally with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` then `python -m pytest tests/`. It only covers the pure-logic modules (settings, pacing, webhook, and friends), so please also describe how you tested a change manually in your PR.

To cut a release: bump `VERSION`, commit, then tag with an **annotated** tag whose message is a short, human-readable changelog: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..." && git push origin vX.Y.Z`. That message becomes both the GitHub Release body and what gets posted to Discord (see below) — a lightweight tag (no `-a`/`-m`) falls back to just the tagged commit's own message, which is usually not what you want announced. Pushing the tag triggers the release workflow, which builds the app exe with PyInstaller (see `build_pyinstaller.py`), packages it together with the user-editable `Assets/` folder into `Creams-Macro-Anime-Expeditions-Windows.zip` (a macOS job builds the `-macOS` twin) — the per-platform zips are the only uploaded assets, which new installs, the auto-updater, and any bootstrapper copies all read from — and publishes a GitHub Release.

Every push to `main` posts a one-line summary to a Discord "git log" channel; every tagged release posts its changelog to a separate Discord "update log" channel. Both are wired via `DISCORD_GIT_LOGS_WEBHOOK`/`DISCORD_UPDATE_LOGS_WEBHOOK` repo secrets (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions) — unset in a fork, so both steps just no-op instead of failing.

To build either exe locally instead of waiting on CI: `pip install pyinstaller`, then `python build_pyinstaller.py` / `python build_bootstrap.py`. Output lands in `dist/`.

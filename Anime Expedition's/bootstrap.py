"""
Tiny bootstrapper for Cream's Macro | Anime Expeditions.

Downloads the real app from GitHub Releases on first run (or when a newer
version is out) and launches it. Built as its own separate, much smaller
exe (see build_bootstrap.py) -- the full app is 40+ MB because of
OpenCV/numpy/pywebview, which this script never imports, so the
bootstrapper itself ends up small enough to share directly (e.g. on
Discord) instead of the full download.

Downloads the release ZIP (exe + the loose, user-editable Assets/ folder
side by side -- see release.yml's packaging step), not just the exe:
Assets stopped being bundled inside the exe (so users can open/replace/add
the macro's reference images without a rebuild -- see core/constants.py's
ASSETS_DIR), which means a bare exe alone can't find any of its reference
images. The exe is always replaced on update; Assets files are extracted
ADD-ONLY (never overwriting one already on disk) so an update can't wipe
out images the user has replaced or added -- same policy core/updater.py's
merge_assets_update applies for in-app updates.

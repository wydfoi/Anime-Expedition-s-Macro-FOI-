"""The macro's actual run loop -- Dashboard > Start. Currently covers the
launch sequence (confirm the task queue isn't empty, confirm we're on the
lobby screen, open Play > Story), picking the first task's map and stage,
Pre Start (camera setup, Team Loadout, a per-map default walk, the task's
Macro Operation template's Pre Start blocks), pressing Start Game, and then
watching the battle for Battle-phase blocks (Upgrade/Sell/Auto Upgrade Unit)
and a Victory/Defeat screen -- which is recorded to run history/win-loss
counts and, if a webhook is configured, reported to Discord as a screenshot
of the result screen plus a rendered win/loss card (see
_handle_match_result/_send_result_webhook -- the stats/reward OCR this used
to do per match now lives only behind Settings > Debug's on-demand "Read
Rewards"/"Read Game Stats" buttons). Equipment include/exclude, and the
rest of the Battle-phase block types (Walk/Wait/Setting), plug in once those

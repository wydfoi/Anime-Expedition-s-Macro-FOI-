name label -- OCR was tried first but was too slow in practice (a multi-
mask/multi-psm Tesseract sweep per card, repeated on every scroll nudge,
added up fast). Each map gets its own reference image instead
(Assets/maps/<map name>.png, named to match a Task's `map` field exactly --
this folder covers Raid maps too, e.g. "Spirit City", not just Story ones)

matching against a live capture (see core.vision).

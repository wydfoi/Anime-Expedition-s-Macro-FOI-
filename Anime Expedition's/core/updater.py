"""Checks GitHub Releases for a newer tagged version than the one in VERSION,
and -- once the user confirms via the Dashboard's update popup -- applies it.
Two different update strategies depending on how the app is actually
running (see core.constants.IS_FROZEN), since "swap in the new files" means
something different in each case:

Running from Python source (dev / git clone): downloads the release's
SOURCE zip (GitHub generates one for any tag automatically) and robocopy's
it over the install dir, skipping anything the user owns (settings.json,
debug/, Paths/, Templates/, regenerated Assets -- same list .gitignore
excludes).

Running as a built exe (see build_pyinstaller.py): downloads the release
zip (the only binary asset a release publishes -- exe + Assets/ side by
side), extracts the new exe out of it, and swaps the exe file itself --
robocopying loose .py source over a compiled exe's directory wouldn't do
anything, the exe doesn't read scattered source files at runtime. The
batch-script swap choreography (wait for the old exe to actually exit,
move it aside, move the new one into place, relaunch, clean up) mirrors
the sibling Anime Squadron project's core.updater, which already solved
it -- ported here rather than re-solving it blind. The user-editable
Assets/ folder beside the exe is NEVER part of the swap -- an update
leaves it alone except for an add-only merge, from that same zip, of any
reference images that are new in the release (see the Assets section
below).

Either way: main.Api.apply_update stages the update, launches the relaunch
helper detached, THEN closes the app -- the helper doesn't touch any files
until this process (and its file handles) are actually gone.

def relaunch_env() -> dict:
    """This process's environment with PyInstaller's private bootloader
    handshake removed, so a child can start a onefile exe from scratch.

    A onefile build runs twice: the bootloader extracts the bundle to
    %TEMP%\\_MEI<random>, sets

        _PYI_ARCHIVE_FILE        the exe the bundle came out of
        _PYI_APPLICATION_HOME_DIR   the _MEI dir it was extracted to
        _PYI_PARENT_PROCESS_LEVEL   how deep we are

    and re-runs itself. Our Python code is that second process, so those
    three are sitting in os.environ and every child we spawn inherits them.

    That is what broke Update & Restart. The helper is a child of the app,
    so `start "" "<exe>"` handed the fresh build an _PYI_ARCHIVE_FILE equal
    to its OWN path -- because the update swaps the new exe onto the old
    one's path. The bootloader reads that as "I am already extracted",
    skips extraction, and loads the interpreter out of
    _PYI_APPLICATION_HOME_DIR -- the previous process's _MEI dir, which
    step [2/5] of the helper deletes. Measured, driving a real frozen build
    through the real helper:

        [PYI-28940:ERROR] Failed to load Python DLL
            'C:\\Users\\...\\Temp\\_MEI302922\\python313.dll'.
        LoadLibrary: The specified module could not be found.

    The exe swap itself always worked; the app just never came back, with
    that error going to a console nobody sees. It also explains why running
    the same _update.bat by hand works -- Explorer starts it with a clean
    environment.

    The path match is the whole trigger, which is why this is specific to
    updating and not to launching in general: bootstrap.exe starting the
    app exe passes the same variables down and is fine, because
    _PYI_ARCHIVE_FILE names bootstrap.exe rather than the exe being
    started, and the bootloader extracts normally.

    Matched by prefix rather than by listing the three names: PyInstaller
    has renamed these before (5.x used a single _MEIPASS2, kept here for
    anyone still building with it), they are private to the bootloader, and
    a rename would bring this failure back silently.

"""Posts a "commit(s) just pushed to main" message to the git-log Discord
webhook -- one embed per commit in this push, not just HEAD.

Used to be a bash+jq one-liner in ci.yml itself, but building nested JSON
(an embed list, each containing a multi-line description) through a chain
of shell variable interpolation + jq calls turned out fragile in practice:
it silently sent Discord an invalid payload on a real multi-commit push
(confirmed via the HTTP 400 body once the workflow was changed to actually
print curl's response instead of discarding it) despite every local
reproduction of the same shell logic working fine -- a real environment
difference too subtle to keep chasing in YAML. Python's own json module
can't produce invalid JSON by construction, so this sidesteps the whole
class of bug rather than trying to out-quote it.

Reads its inputs from environment variables (set by the calling workflow
step) rather than argv, so the workflow YAML doesn't need to shell-escape
anything into a command line either.
